	  <h3>1.How do I pay?</h3>
	  <div>
	    <p>After sending a reservation request, if the roller or guide accepts, you can proceed with the payment.
Currently (2018.06.01) Rolling Potato's payment method is Paypal.
Please complete your payment within 24 hours of acceptance.
When the payment is completed, the reservation will be confirmed.</p>
	  </div>
	  <h3>2.What is the cancellation / refund policy?</h3>
	  <div>
	    <p>You can cancel at any stage after your reservation request.
However, the refund policy is as follows.
If you cancel 3 days prior to your travel date, you will receive 90% refund.
If you cancel between 2 days and 1 day prior to your travel date, you will receive a 50% refund.
Cancellations after the day of travel are non-refundable.</p>
	  </div>
	  <h3>3.Are there exceptions to the cancel&refund policy?</h3>
	  <div>
	    <p>In extenuating circumstances, such as an emergency situation, we can refund exceptionally.
The extenuating circumstances are as follows.
** Serious illness or injury that directly restricts a traveller's ability to travel.
** Unexpected death or serious illness of immediate family members (spouse, child, parent, sibling)
** Significant natural disasters or severe weather incidents impacting the location of destination or location of departure
Claims can only be considered after a reservation has been canceled.
Once you've informed your roller or your guide and canceled a reservation, if you feel that your reason for cancelation is covered by Rolling Potatoâ€™s Extenuating Circumstances Policy, contact Rolling Potato for consideration. We generally require claims to be submitted no later than 14 days from the original travel date and we may require valid supporting documentation.</p>
